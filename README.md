# Simple SNII model nucleosynthesis

This notebook allows you to explore core-collapse supernova
nucleosynthesis in a simple model. You can run the notebook on [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) by clicking on the Open in Colab badge at the end of this paragraph.  You will need to sign in with your Google account.  Execute the whole notebook by clicking on Run all from the Runtime menu.  You can then change inputs or code in the notebook, as desired.  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mbradle/NRLEE-Nucleosynthesis/blob/main/simple_sn2_nb.ipynb)

Alternatively, you can run on your local computer.  To do so, once you have installed [the Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org), download the linked notebook above (right-click or control-click).  To run the notebook from the command line, type, for example,

**jupyter notebook simple_sn2_nb.ipynb**

Be sure to remove any suffix that is not *.ipynb* on the notebook file you download.  For example, some browsers will by default add a *.txt* to the downloaded file so that it has suffix *.ipynb.txt*.  Remove the *.txt* before running.
